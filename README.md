# Bolt

A dead simple (and probably broken) playlist file converter for converting `.m3u8` playlists to [Dopamine](https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine-windows)'s `.m3u` playlist format.

### Installlation
You can get the binaries on the [releases]() tab.

### Usage
To convert a playlist open a terminal and type the following command.
```bash
bolt "<path-to-playlist-file.m3u8>"
```

> Please make sure to replace `<path-to-playlist-file.m3u8>` with the path to the playlist file.
